# Install RAKI Verbalizer

We want to create a docker image installing some dependecy from
a private github repository using SSH read keys.

Always keep your SSH keys protected and private.
The first stage of this build, where the SSH key is,
won't be present in the final image, hence not exposing any sensitive information.

## How To
1. Generate a SSH key
```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your@email.com"
```

2. Add the public key as _read-only_ to the repositories or ask the maintainer to do so.

3. Run the script:
```bash
    # export path to the private key
    export KEY_PATH=<your-private-key-path>
    ./dockerBuild.sh
```
